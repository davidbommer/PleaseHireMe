# Machine learning stock prediction model
I'm not desperate or anything, but please, please, please, please hire me. 
All joking aside here is my first real project. 

I'd like to thank sentex's video tutorial on youtube for inspiration and for supplying very useful training data. 
Finding historical data on stocks (for free) that I would use to train my model have proved to be difficult to say the least. However, sentex provided a sample dataset, "straight HTML data as if you had parsed Yahoo Finance for over a decade." called intraQuarter.zip. 

Historical Data:
  It turns out, the machine learning part of a machine learning project is by far the easiest part. The hard part is getting your hands on the necessary data. We need three datasets:
    1) Historical Stock Statistics: Training Features
    2) Historical Stock Prices: Training Labels 
    3) Historical S&P500 Prices: 

Historical Stock Statistics:
     I'll be the first to admit that I was at a loss on how to get my hands on this data until I watched Sentex's video series. He provided intrQuarter.zip which I will parse and put into a .csv file. This will be the features:
     'Market Cap'
      Enterprise Value
      Trailing P/E
      Forward P/E
      PEG Ratio
      Price/Sales
      Price/Book
      Enterprise Value/Revenue
      Enterprise Value/EBITDA
